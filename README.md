A reference implementation of a high performance, low latency exchange.

Status
------

This is very much a work in progress. Consequently the current implementation
is neither high performance nor low latency and further makes no claims as to
doing anything useful beyond making your CPU generating heat.

Changelog
---------

### 0.1.0
- Basic implementation of a LimitOrderBook
- Skeleton Exchange implementation & Message Bus integration
